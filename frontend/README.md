# chat-client

This is the frontend for the chat application that uses Vue and UnoCSS.

## installation

You can find installation instructions at https://github.com/kurenai-11/blog-real-project as this project uses the same template.
For the point 4, here you instead change the BACKEND_URL variable to the backend url in frontend/main.ts to connect frontend with the backend correctly.
